# Ice Sheet Analysis Project

## Overview
This project analyzes data collected from ice sheets on Planet Clara. The program evaluates ice hardness and thickness, identifying potential fracture points and cracks, which are crucial for understanding ice stability.

## Features
- **Data Analysis:** Reads and processes 2D array data representing ice hardness and thickness.
- **Fracture Point Detection:** Identifies potential fracture points in the ice sheets.
- **Crack Analysis:** Determines which fracture points could lead to cracks.
- **Reporting:** Summarizes the number of fracture points and crack points.

## Technologies Used
- Java
- IntelliJ IDEA

## How to Run
1. **Compile the Java files:**
   ```shell
   javac Main.java
   ```
2. **Run the program:**
   ```shell
   java Main
   ```

## Project Structure
- `src/Main.java`: Main program file that contains the logic for analyzing ice sheets.
- `ICESHEETS.TXT`: Input data file with ice sheet measurements.

## Future Improvements
- Enhance the algorithm to handle larger data sets efficiently.
- Add a graphical user interface for better data visualization.
